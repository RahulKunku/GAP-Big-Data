This Python script is designed to perform web scraping and text analysis on reviews from two different websites: Gap and Zara. It uses various libraries and tools to achieve this task. Below, you will find a detailed explanation of the script's functionality and usage.
Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

    Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

    Required Python Libraries:
        bs4 (Beautiful Soup 4): For parsing HTML content.
        selenium: For automating web interactions and extracting web content.
        webdriver_manager: For managing the Firefox WebDriver.
        requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
        nltk: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and stopword removal.
        csv: For reading and writing CSV files.
        azure-ai-textanalytics: For performing sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction using Microsoft Azure Text Analytics service.

    Mozilla Firefox: Ensure you have Mozilla Firefox installed, as the script uses the Firefox WebDriver for web scraping.

    Azure Text Analytics Service: You will need an Azure Text Analytics service key and endpoint to perform sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction. Replace the placeholders for key and endpoint with your Azure Text Analytics credentials.

Usage

    Web Scraping:
        The script first collects reviews from Gap and Zara websites by web scraping using Selenium and Beautiful Soup.
        It creates lists text_gap and text_zara to store the scraped reviews from Gap and Zara, respectively.

    CSV Export:
        The script then exports the scraped reviews to CSV files named text_gap.csv and text_zara.csv for Gap and Zara, respectively.

    Azure Text Analytics:
        The script performs sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction on the scraped reviews using Azure Text Analytics service.
        It sends each review to Azure for analysis and stores the results in azure_sentiments and azure_keyphrases lists.

    CSV Export of Sentiments:
        The script exports the sentiments (positive, neutral, or negative) of the Gap reviews to a CSV file named sentiment_gap.csv.

Important Notes

    Uncomment the pip install azure-ai-textanalytics line to install the Azure Text Analytics Python SDK if you haven't already.
    Ensure that you have replaced the placeholders for Azure Text Analytics key and endpoint with your actual credentials.
    You can adjust the sleep times and other parameters in the script to control the scraping rate and behavior.
    Additional error handling and customization can be added to suit your specific needs.

Note: Be mindful of website terms of service and scraping policies when using this script, as web scraping may be subject to legal and ethical considerations.
