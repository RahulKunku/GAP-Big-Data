Nice basic t-shirts and you can get them with a big discount. I order here regularly and the quality is on a high level.
I placed an order from Gap on Black Friday. When I received the box there was only 2 items out of the 12 that I ordered As well as two pj onesies from Old Navy which obviously I didn't order from Gap. I called multiple times and finally after the 4th time they said they can't refund my money until I returned those two items. I tried to return them in person and they wouldn't return them and give me a refund for the items I never received.

"BE AWARE! - Their online return policy on all GAP-GAP FACTORY-OLD NAVY is a complete SCAM! You have 30 days from SHIPMENT date to have your returned package ARRIVE to their warehouse! And it can take up to 15 days for it to arrive! This means that you basically really have just 15 days from the day your order will be shipped to you to the day you make the return. Assuming that the original order might take up to 7 days to arrive to you, you only have about 8 days to decide if you are keeping the items or not. Good luck!I spoke with a customer service agent on June 20th for an order that was placed on May 28th and he told me that if I mail my package today it's not sure it will arrive by June28th at the warehouse as it might take up to 15 days, so if it doesn't arrive on time the return of 150$ won't be accepted!

I will never purchase anything from this store again. I purchased online and by the time I received it tried it on and figured out how to do a return.

I have been shopping at Gap for years. There is no longer a store in my city so I am forced to order online. I bought a flannel shirt on 12/26 that was discounted 40%. I never saw that it was a final sale. Any final sale I've purchased is discounted a least 70%. The shirt is too small and when I called to get a return I was told it was a final sale and not eligible for return UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. So now I am out $58 for a shirt I can't wear.

Nice basic t-shirts and you can get them with a big discount. I order here regularly and the quality is on a high level.
I placed an order from Gap on Black Friday. When I received the box there was only 2 items out of the 12 that I ordered As well as two pj onesies from Old Navy which obviously I didn't order from Gap. I called multiple times and finally after the 4th time they said they can't refund my money until I returned those two items. I tried to return them in person and they wouldn't return them and give me a refund for the items I never received.

"BE AWARE! - Their online return policy on all GAP-GAP FACTORY-OLD NAVY is a complete SCAM! You have 30 days from SHIPMENT date to have your returned package ARRIVE to their warehouse! And it can take up to 15 days for it to arrive! This means that you basically really have just 15 days from the day your order will be shipped to you to the day you make the return. Assuming that the original order might take up to 7 days to arrive to you, you only have about 8 days to decide if you are keeping the items or not. Good luck!I spoke with a customer service agent on June 20th for an order that was placed on May 28th and he told me that if I mail my package today it's not sure it will arrive by June28th at the warehouse as it might take up to 15 days, so if it doesn't arrive on time the return of 150$ won't be accepted!

I will never purchase anything from this store again. I purchased online and by the time I received it tried it on and figured out how to do a return.

I have been shopping at Gap for years. There is no longer a store in my city so I am forced to order online. I bought a flannel shirt on 12/26 that was discounted 40%. I never saw that it was a final sale. Any final sale I've purchased is discounted a least 70%. The shirt is too small and when I called to get a return I was told it was a final sale and not eligible for return UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. So now I am out $58 for a shirt I can't wear.

Worst shopping experience with GAP! It was my first time shopping here and I was so disappointed. I always thought buying from a brand name company would be durable and lasting but I was wrong. Bought a pair of pants and the quality was so poor. Will never shop from here again.
I got two pairs of dress pants for $80 ea and the side seam on one of the pockets ripped within a week causing my butt to be visible at work. The second pair faded within a month and no longer fits around my waist/torso area. They also don't offer returns if the product has been worn. The material is poor and it's frustrating when you spend your money looking for quality and you end up with the same stuff you get at Walmart.

Nice basic t-shirts and you can get them with a big discount. I order here regularly and the quality is on a high level.
I placed an order from Gap on Black Friday. When I received the box there was only 2 items out of the 12 that I ordered As well as two pj onesies from Old Navy which obviously I didn't order from Gap. I called multiple times and finally after the 4th time they said they can't refund my money until I returned those two items. I tried to return them in person and they wouldn't return them and give me a refund for the items I never received. This is absolutely horrible.Tip for consumers:Never shop here!Products used:When I received the box there was only 2 items out of the 12 that I ordered As well as two pj onesies from Old Navy which obviously I didn't order from Gap.

"BE AWARE! - Their online return policy on all GAP-GAP FACTORY-OLD NAVY is a complete SCAM! You have 30 days from SHIPMENT date to have your returned package ARRIVE to their warehouse! And it can take up to 15 days for it to arrive! This means that you basically really have just 15 days from the day your order will be shipped to you to the day you make the return. Assuming that the original order might take up to 7 days to arrive to you, you only have about 8 days to decide if you are keeping the items or not. Good luck!I spoke with a customer service agent on June 20th for an order that was placed on May 28th and he told me that if I mail my package today it's not sure it will arrive by June28th at the warehouse as it might take up to 15 days, so if it doesn't arrive on time the return of 150$ won't be accepted!

I will never purchase anything from this store again. I purchased online and by the time I received it tried it on and figured out how to do a return.

I have been shopping at Gap for years. There is no longer a store in my city so I am forced to order online. I bought a flannel shirt on 12/26 that was discounted 40%. I never saw that it was a final sale. Any final sale I've purchased is discounted a least 70%. The shirt is too small and when I called to get a return I was told it was a final sale and not eligible for return UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. So now I am out $58 for a shirt I can't wear. THIS IS A SCAM. I will never give Gap my business again. Show more

Worst shopping experience with GAP! It was my first time shopping here and I was so disappointed. I always thought buying from a brand name company would be durable and lasting but I was wrong. Bought a pair of pants and the quality was so poor. Will never shop from here again.
I got two pairs of dress pants for $80 ea and the side seam on one of the pockets ripped within a week causing my butt to be visible at work. The second pair faded within a month and no longer fits around my waist/torso area. They also don't offer returns if the product has been worn. The material is poor and it's frustrating when you spend your money looking for quality and you end up with the same stuff you get at Walmart.

Nice basic t-shirts and you can get them with a big discount. I order here regularly and the quality is on a high level.
I placed an order from Gap on Black Friday. When I received the box there was only 2 items out of the 12 that I ordered As well as two pj onesies from Old Navy which obviously I didn't order from Gap. I called multiple times and finally after the 4th time they said they can't refund my money until I returned those two items. I tried to return them in person and they wouldn't return them and give me a refund for the items I never received. This is absolutely horrible.Tip for consumers:Never shop here!Products used:When I received the box there was only 2 items out of the 12 that I ordered As well as two pj onesies from Old Navy which obviously I didn't order from Gap.

"BE AWARE! - Their online return policy on all GAP-GAP FACTORY-OLD NAVY is a complete SCAM! You have 30 days from SHIPMENT date to have your returned package ARRIVE to their warehouse! And it can take up to 15 days for it to arrive! This means that you basically really have just 15 days from the day your order will be shipped to you to the day you make the return. Assuming that the original order might take up to 7 days to arrive to you, you only have about 8 days to decide if you are keeping the items or not. Good luck!I spoke with a customer service agent on June 20th for an order that was placed on May 28th and he told me that if I mail my package today it's not sure it will arrive by June28th at the warehouse as it might take up to 15 days, so if it doesn't arrive on time the return of 150$ won't be accepted!

I will never purchase anything from this store again. I purchased online and by the time I received it tried it on and figured out how to do a return.

I have been shopping at Gap for years. There is no longer a store in my city so I am forced to order online. I bought a flannel shirt on 12/26 that was discounted 40%. I never saw that it was a final sale. Any final sale I've purchased is discounted a least 70%. The shirt is too small and when I called to get a return I was told it was a final sale and not eligible for return UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. So now I am out $58 for a shirt I can't wear. THIS IS A SCAM. I will never give Gap my business again. Show more

Worst shopping experience with GAP! It was my first time shopping here and I was so disappointed. I always thought buying from a brand name company would be durable and lasting but I was wrong. Bought a pair of pants and the quality was so poor. Will never shop from here again.
I got two pairs of dress pants for $80 ea and the side seam on one of the pockets ripped within a week causing my butt to be visible at work. The second pair faded within a month and no longer fits around my waist/torso area. They also don't offer returns if the product has been worn. The material is poor and it's frustrating when you spend your money looking for quality and you end up with the same stuff you get at Walmart.

Nice basic t-shirts and you can get them with a big discount. I order here regularly and the quality is on a high level.
I placed an order from Gap on Black Friday. When I received the box there was only 2 items out of the 12 that I ordered As well as two pj onesies from Old Navy which obviously I didn't order from Gap. I called multiple times and finally after the 4th time they said they can't refund my money until I returned those two items. I tried to return them in person and they wouldn't return them and give me a refund for the items I never received. This is absolutely horrible.Tip for consumers:Never shop here!Products used:When I received the box there was only 2 items out of the 12 that I ordered As well as two pj onesies from Old Navy which obviously I didn't order from Gap.

"BE AWARE! - Their online return policy on all GAP-GAP FACTORY-OLD NAVY is a complete SCAM! You have 30 days from SHIPMENT date to have your returned package ARRIVE to their warehouse! And it can take up to 15 days for it to arrive! This means that you basically really have just 15 days from the day your order will be shipped to you to the day you make the return. Assuming that the original order might take up to 7 days to arrive to you, you only have about 8 days to decide if you are keeping the items or not. Good luck!I spoke with a customer service agent on June 20th for an order that was placed on May 28th and he told me that if I mail my package today it's not sure it will arrive by June28th at the warehouse as it might take up to 15 days, so if it doesn't arrive on time the return of 150$ won't be accepted!

I will never purchase anything from this store again. I purchased online and by the time I received it tried it on and figured out how to do a return.

I have been shopping at Gap for years. There is no longer a store in my city so I am forced to order online. I bought a flannel shirt on 12/26 that was discounted 40%. I never saw that it was a final sale. Any final sale I've purchased is discounted a least 70%. The shirt is too small and when I called to get a return I was told it was a final sale and not eligible for return UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. So now I am out $58 for a shirt I can't wear. THIS IS A SCAM. I will never give Gap my business again. Show more

Worst shopping experience with GAP! It was my first time shopping here and I was so disappointed. I always thought buying from a brand name company would be durable and lasting but I was wrong. Bought a pair of pants and the quality was so poor. Will never shop from here again.
I got two pairs of dress pants for $80 ea and the side seam on one of the pockets ripped within a week causing my butt to be visible at work. The second pair faded within a month and no longer fits around my waist/torso area. They also don't offer returns if the product has been worn. The material is poor and it's frustrating when you spend your money looking for quality and you end up with the same stuff you get at Walmart.
