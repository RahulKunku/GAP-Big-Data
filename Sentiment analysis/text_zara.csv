I purchased a swimsuit at Zara's Disney Springs location in Orlando on 5/27/23. After wearing the swimsuit once it faded. I did not realize that the swimsuit was defective until I was back at home in North Carolina. There is no Zara retail store close to me so I called the company on 5/31/23 to let them know what happened with the swimsuit [I had to call two times to get an answer] I received an email on 6/14/23 stating that they regret they cannot help me since this was a store purchase and only a store manager can accommodate or deny my request. So basically I have to drive 10 hours or pay to fly to the nearest Zara to get my money back or do an exchange. This is totally ridiculous.

"Zara would not take two of my online returns because they said I did not follow the return policy and because my clothes smelled like perfume they would not return them.

I went to smell the clothes because they claimed they smelled like perfume, which is strange because I don't often wear perfume.

I purchased a swimsuit at Zara's Disney Springs location in Orlando on 5/27/23. After wearing the swimsuit once it faded. I did not realize that the swimsuit was defective until I was back at home in North Carolina. There is no Zara retail store close to me so I called the company on 5/31/23 to let them know what happened with the swimsuit [I had to call two times to get an answer] I received an email on 6/14/23 stating that they regret they cannot help me since this was a store purchase and only a store manager can accommodate or deny my request. So basically I have to drive 10 hours or pay to fly to the nearest Zara to get my money back or do an exchange. This is totally ridiculous.

"Well, it's a pretty good mass market store. If you need to buy something for your outfit and if you want to look fresh and modern, then you can come over this store and find something up to your taste.For sure, the quality/price ratio of sold apparel here is on a good level, I mean you won't have a feeling that you overpaid.

"Zara would not take two of my online returns because they said I did not follow the return policy and because my clothes smelled like perfume they would not return them. When I asked to speak to a manager about this policy, I was told that the manager was unavailable. I will never shop as are online again and I suggest you do the same if they can make such incredible claims without any founded information.I would like to follow up with the fact that I just received my order back in the mail not only was the package not even opened. I went to smell the clothes because they claimed they smelled like perfume, which is strange because I don't often wear perfume.

This last time, I placed an online order. Not only did the order arrive almost a week late, but then I didn't have time to return it. Zara states that you get 30 days from the 'shipping date'. That's the WORST company policy. When you call, you speak to someone in a foreign country and you can't speak to a manager. They do not allow for store credit. Now, I'm stuck with clothing that I won't wear. Needless to say, I will NEVER shop at Zara again.Products used:pantsServiceValueShippingReturnsQuality Show more"

On the delivery day, as I tracked it through Fedex, it shows ""invalid address/recipient moved"" thus unable to deliver. I contacted Zara customer service right away but ""Mary"" the rep just flat out refused to help me solve the issue.

She told me I can try calling Fedex myself to see if they can change the address otherwise there's nothing she can do to help me with my order as per ""policy.""

After all the back and forth with 3 different reps, no this no that, I just accepted my refund.In store, customer service is also very lacking.

I did not realize that the swimsuit was defective until I was back at home in North Carolina. There is no Zara retail store close to me so I called the company on 5/31/23 to let them know what happened with the swimsuit [I had to call two times to get an answer] I received an email on 6/14/23 stating that they regret they cannot help me since this was a store purchase and only a store manager can accommodate or deny my request. So basically I have to drive 10 hours or pay to fly to the nearest Zara to get my money back or do an exchange. This is totally ridiculous. Needless to say I will not be going back to Zara.Products used:SwimsuitServiceValueReturnsQuality Show more
"Well, it's a pretty good mass market store. If you need to buy something for your outfit and if you want to look fresh and modern, then you can come over this store and find something up to your taste.For sure, the quality/price ratio of sold apparel here is on a good level, I mean you won't have a feeling that you overpaid. That's why I respect such mass market stores and this one as well."
"I bought a pair of $48 slacks at full price. The gold buttons on the pockets fell off after wearing then for 3 hours. The store at La Cantera San Antonio Texas gave me a ton of excuses as to why they would not allow me to return the defective garment. They sent me over to the customer service number which was an absolute joke. I advise everyone to stay clear of shopping at the Zara. It is such a scam shop at stores that stand behind their products 100% of the time, I am so disappointed in Zara.

"If you are going to shop at Zara, do it in person. Every online order I've placed has encountered major issues and delays, resulting in huge headaches.

No answers from Zara.Tip for consumers:Avoid ordering anything online at Zara.

"Zara would not take two of my online returns because they said I did not follow the return policy and because my clothes smelled like perfume they would not return them. When I asked to speak to a manager about this policy, I was told that the manager was unavailable. I will never shop as are online again and I suggest you do the same if they can make such incredible claims without any founded information.I would like to follow up with the fact that I just received my order back in the mail not only was the package not even opened. I went to smell the clothes because they claimed they smelled like perfume, which is strange because I don't often wear perfume. And we all smelled the clothes and didn't smell a scent of perfume on them. There is no way to prove this on either side and the fact that this is a policy that Zara stands behind is completely insane.ServiceValueShippingReturnsQuality Show more"
"Zara Dress Shop exceeded my expectations in terms of both product quality and customer service. With their wide selection of fashionable dresses, attentive staff, and inviting store environment, it's clear that they prioritize customer satisfaction.

"Zara's clothes are not great. They're often poor quality, but hey...you get what you pay for. I've bought things from their store in the past, but have always tried things on in the store. This last time, I placed an online order. Not only did the order arrive almost a week late, but then I didn't have time to return it. Zara states that you get 30 days from the 'shipping date'. That's the WORST company policy. When you call, you speak to someone in a foreign country and you can't speak to a manager. They do not allow for store credit. Now, I'm stuck with clothing that I won't wear. Needless to say, I will NEVER shop at Zara again.Products used:pantsServiceValueShippingReturnsQuality Show more"
"WARNING***If you need to make a return don't expect it to go quickly. The reality is they don't want your return. They want your money and if you return the bag too. They don't refund you for that.

Then the gentleman was shuffling hangers and sorting the returned merch.

"I purchased a dress from Zara online. I returned the item as I found it too small. I did open the package but never tried the dress and packed it back into original paper packaging. Two weeks later received an email that they will not refund me as the dress has signed of using. Impossible as I never even tried it on. Contacted Customer Service via WhatsApp as they do not have contact line. The customer service was highly unprofessional as they were ignoring me when asked for reports from our conversation and pictures of labels confirms that it was the dress which I have send to them. Also, they didn't want to provide the name of the person I was talk with. They send me random picture of the dress with black stain. It is not proving that I made the stain which I didn't as I didn't even wore it. It could be damaged in the warehouse or during the delivery. Now they are sending me only automatic messages how sorry they are but they won't refund me for the dress. They claims that they send it back but didn't want to provide the tracking number etc. now they sending me damaged dress without the refund. Highly DO NOT Recommend buying anything with Zara.

"A month ago, i ordered 3 pairs of jeans. All size 4, but one fit like it was a 0. I returned them two weeks later, but i realized that i had to cancel my card eventually because i was moving out of the country. I talked to a customer representative and she was helpful! She began the refund process before i had to cancel my card. Even though the sizes were inconsistent, customer service made up for it. Would've been 2-3 stars."
"I placed an order using the Zara app and I decided to go with ""pick up point"" delivery. When you use the app, you enter your zipcode and the app gives you the nearest locations that you are able to pick up. Well I did that, waited for my order to get delivered to the pick up point. On the delivery day, as I tracked it through Fedex, it shows ""invalid address/recipient moved"" thus unable to deliver. I contacted Zara customer service right away but ""Mary"" the rep just flat out refused to help me solve the issue. She said I can get my refund but I won't be able get a replacement because one of the item was on sale. She told me I can try calling Fedex myself to see if they can change the address otherwise there's nothing she can do to help me with my order as per ""policy."" Just pure disregard for customer satisfaction. Mind you, this address was the one that they gave me as an option, on the app. This company does not take responsibility or accountability on their part when issues like this arise. After all the back and forth with 3 different reps, no this no that, I just accepted my refund.In store, customer service is also very lacking. It's very rare to see an employee that's nice and approachable. That is why I preferred online shopping but not after this incident.

I purchased two items that were on a sale. Each item was highlighted in yellow as discounted and it was advertised that there was a huge sale today. At the end of the purchase nothing was for sale any more and ended up paying 15-20 dollars more than we expected.

"Zara would not take two of my online returns because they said I did not follow the return policy and because my clothes smelled like perfume they would not return them. When I asked to speak to a manager about this policy, I was told that the manager was unavailable. I will never shop as are online again and I suggest you do the same if they can make such incredible claims without any founded information.I would like to follow up with the fact that I just received my order back in the mail not only was the package not even opened. I went to smell the clothes because they claimed they smelled like perfume, which is strange because I don't often wear perfume.

"Zara's clothes are not great. They're often poor quality, but hey...you get what you pay for. I've bought things from their store in the past, but have always tried things on in the store. This last time, I placed an online order. Not only did the order arrive almost a week late, but then I didn't have time to return it. Zara states that you get 30 days from the 'shipping date'. That's the WORST company policy. When you call, you speak to someone in a foreign country and you can't speak to a manager. They do not allow for store credit. Now, I'm stuck with clothing that I won't wear. Needless to say, I will NEVER shop at Zara again.Products used:pantsServiceValueShippingReturnsQuality Show more"

Then the gentleman was shuffling hangers and sorting the returned merch.

Two weeks later received an email that they will not refund me as the dress has signed of using. Impossible as I never even tried it on. Contacted Customer Service via WhatsApp as they do not have contact line. The customer service was highly unprofessional as they were ignoring me when asked for reports from our conversation and pictures of labels confirms that it was the dress which I have send to them. Also, they didn't want to provide the name of the person I was talk with. They send me random picture of the dress with black stain. It is not proving that I made the stain which I didn't as I didn't even wore it. It could be damaged in the warehouse or during the delivery. Now they are sending me only automatic messages how sorry they are but they won't refund me for the dress. They claims that they send it back but didn't want to provide the tracking number etc. now they sending me damaged dress without the refund. Highly DO NOT Recommend buying anything with Zara.

"A month ago, i ordered 3 pairs of jeans. All size 4, but one fit like it was a 0. I returned them two weeks later, but i realized that i had to cancel my card eventually because i was moving out of the country. I talked to a customer representative and she was helpful! She began the refund process before i had to cancel my card. Even though the sizes were inconsistent, customer service made up for it. Would've been 2-3 stars."
"I placed an order using the Zara app and I decided to go with ""pick up point"" delivery. When you use the app, you enter your zipcode and the app gives you the nearest locations that you are able to pick up. Well I did that, waited for my order to get delivered to the pick up point. On the delivery day, as I tracked it through Fedex, it shows ""invalid address/recipient moved"" thus unable to deliver. I contacted Zara customer service right away but ""Mary"" the rep just flat out refused to help me solve the issue. She said I can get my refund but I won't be able get a replacement because one of the item was on sale. She told me I can try calling Fedex myself to see if they can change the address otherwise there's nothing she can do to help me with my order as per ""policy."" Just pure disregard for customer satisfaction. Mind you, this address was the one that they gave me as an option, on the app. This company does not take responsibility or accountability on their part when issues like this arise. After all the back and forth with 3 different reps, no this no that, I just accepted my refund.In store, customer service is also very lacking. It's very rare to see an employee that's nice and approachable. That is why I preferred online shopping but not after this incident.

At the end of the purchase nothing was for sale any more and ended up paying 15-20 dollars more than we expected.

That's the WORST company policy. When you call, you speak to someone in a foreign country and you can't speak to a manager. They do not allow for store credit. Now, I'm stuck with clothing that I won't wear. Needless to say, I will NEVER shop at Zara again.Products used:pantsServiceValueShippingReturnsQuality Show more"

Two weeks later received an email that they will not refund me as the dress has signed of using. Impossible as I never even tried it on. Contacted Customer Service via WhatsApp as they do not have contact line. The customer service was highly unprofessional as they were ignoring me when asked for reports from our conversation and pictures of labels confirms that it was the dress which I have send to them. Also, they didn't want to provide the name of the person I was talk with. They send me random picture of the dress with black stain. It is not proving that I made the stain which I didn't as I didn't even wore it. It could be damaged in the warehouse or during the delivery. Now they are sending me only automatic messages how sorry they are but they won't refund me for the dress. They claims that they send it back but didn't want to provide the tracking number etc. now they sending me damaged dress without the refund. Highly DO NOT Recommend buying anything with Zara.

"A month ago, i ordered 3 pairs of jeans. All size 4, but one fit like it was a 0. I returned them two weeks later, but i realized that i had to cancel my card eventually because i was moving out of the country. I talked to a customer representative and she was helpful! She began the refund process before i had to cancel my card. Even though the sizes were inconsistent, customer service made up for it. Would've been 2-3 stars."
"I placed an order using the Zara app and I decided to go with ""pick up point"" delivery. When you use the app, you enter your zipcode and the app gives you the nearest locations that you are able to pick up. Well I did that, waited for my order to get delivered to the pick up point. On the delivery day, as I tracked it through Fedex, it shows ""invalid address/recipient moved"" thus unable to deliver. I contacted Zara customer service right away but ""Mary"" the rep just flat out refused to help me solve the issue. She said I can get my refund but I won't be able get a replacement because one of the item was on sale. She told me I can try calling Fedex myself to see if they can change the address otherwise there's nothing she can do to help me with my order as per ""policy."" Just pure disregard for customer satisfaction. Mind you, this address was the one that they gave me as an option, on the app. This company does not take responsibility or accountability on their part when issues like this arise. After all the back and forth with 3 different reps, no this no that, I just accepted my refund.In store, customer service is also very lacking. It's very rare to see an employee that's nice and approachable. That is why I preferred online shopping but not after this incident.

At the end of the purchase nothing was for sale any more and ended up paying 15-20 dollars more than we expected.

I purchased a swimsuit at Zara's Disney Springs location in Orlando on 5/27/23. After wearing the swimsuit once it faded.

There is no Zara retail store close to me so I called the company on 5/31/23 to let them know what happened with the swimsuit [I had to call two times to get an answer] I received an email on 6/14/23 stating that they regret they cannot help me since this was a store purchase and only a store manager can accommodate or deny my request.

"A month ago, i ordered 3 pairs of jeans. All size 4, but one fit like it was a 0. I returned them two weeks later, but i realized that i had to cancel my card eventually because i was moving out of the country. I talked to a customer representative and she was helpful! She began the refund process before i had to cancel my card. Even though the sizes were inconsistent, customer service made up for it. Would've been 2-3 stars."
"I placed an order using the Zara app and I decided to go with ""pick up point"" delivery.

On the delivery day, as I tracked it through Fedex, it shows ""invalid address/recipient moved"" thus unable to deliver. I contacted Zara customer service right away but ""Mary"" the rep just flat out refused to help me solve the issue.

I purchased a swimsuit at Zara's Disney Springs location in Orlando on 5/27/23. After wearing the swimsuit once it faded.

There is no Zara retail store close to me so I called the company on 5/31/23 to let them know what happened with the swimsuit [I had to call two times to get an answer] I received an email on 6/14/23 stating that they regret they cannot help me since this was a store purchase and only a store manager can accommodate or deny my request.

I purchased a swimsuit at Zara's Disney Springs location in Orlando on 5/27/23. After wearing the swimsuit once it faded.

There is no Zara retail store close to me so I called the company on 5/31/23 to let them know what happened with the swimsuit [I had to call two times to get an answer] I received an email on 6/14/23 stating that they regret they cannot help me since this was a store purchase and only a store manager can accommodate or deny my request.

DO NOT buy online with Zara they have poor customer services policy and clearly have an opinion that they are such a big company that losing one customer is not of any consequence to them.I am now stuck with a crappy poorly made jumpsuit that would just about fit a 14 year old stuck thin teenage girl ( despite being labelled large)Will be sticking with retailers that actually believe each customer is of value - poor poor customer serviceTip for consumers:NoProducts used:JumpsuitServiceValueShippingReturnsQuality Show more"
Very bad customer service. I returned a product and received a IN card of Zara from store almost 2 weeks this card is not working. Multiple times I messaged the customer service in chat as well as in WhatsApp twice they changed and updated case numbers. High escalations and high priority case as per them. Yet I didn't get any single call or card replacement. Irresponsible customer service
