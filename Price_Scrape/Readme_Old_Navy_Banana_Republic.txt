This README provides an overview of the Python code that performs two tasks: web scraping and hypothesis testing. The code collects price data for Banana Republic dresses from the ThredUp website and then conducts a hypothesis test to compare prices between two clothing brands, Old Navy and Banana Republic.

Web Scraping (Price Collection)
Prerequisites
Before running the web scraping part of the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Selenium: Install Selenium using pip if you haven't already:

Copy code
pip install selenium
BeautifulSoup4 (bs4): Install BeautifulSoup4 using pip:

Copy code
pip install beautifulsoup4
Code Explanation
Import necessary libraries:

The code starts by importing required libraries, including Selenium for web automation and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing.
Set up the Selenium WebDriver:

It sets up a Selenium WebDriver to interact with a Firefox browser. The options include disabling the sandbox and configuring the browser to avoid using shared memory (--disable-dev-shm-usage).
Define the URL:

The url variable holds the URL of the ThredUp website, specifically the page for Banana Republic dresses.
Scraping and Data Collection:

The script navigates to the provided URL, waits for a random time between 3 to 7 seconds, and then collects the HTML content of the page.

It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract price information for Banana Republic dresses. Prices are extracted by finding specific HTML elements and class names.

The extracted prices are converted to float values and stored in the text_gap list.

Saving to CSV:

The code saves the collected price data to a CSV file named Banana_Republic_Prices.csv. Each price is written to a separate row in the file.
Web Driver Cleanup:

The script closes the Firefox browser and releases associated resources using driver.quit().
Hypothesis Testing (Price Comparison)
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

NumPy: You can install NumPy using pip if it's not already installed:

Copy code
pip install numpy
SciPy: Install SciPy using pip if you haven't already:

Copy code
pip install scipy
Code Explanation
Import necessary libraries:

The code imports NumPy and SciPy libraries for statistical analysis.
Define price data for two brands:

Lists Old_Navy_prices and Banana_Republic_prices contain price data for clothing items from Old Navy and Banana Republic, respectively.
Perform a Two-Sample T-Test:

The script calculates the t-statistic and p-value using stats.ttest_ind(). This tests whether there is a significant difference in prices between the two brands.
Set the Significance Level:

The code sets the significance level (alpha) to 0.05, representing a 5% significance level.
Compare P-Value:

It compares the calculated p-value to the significance level.
If the p-value is less than alpha, it indicates a significant difference between the two brands' prices, and a message is printed.
If the p-value is greater than or equal to alpha, it suggests no significant difference, and a different message is printed.
Finally, the p-value is printed to display the exact probability calculated during the t-test.

Output Interpretation
For the web scraping part, the code collects prices of Banana Republic dresses from the ThredUp website and saves them to a CSV file.

For the hypothesis testing part, it tests whether there is a significant difference in prices between Old Navy and Banana Republic clothing items. The output message indicates whether there is a significant difference based on the chosen significance level (alpha).
