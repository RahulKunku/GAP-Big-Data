US Census State Population Data Downloader
This Python script automates the process of downloading state-wise population data Excel files from the US Census website for the years 2020-2022.

Dependencies:
pandas: Used for reading the Excel files to extract state names.
requests: Used for making HTTP requests to download the Excel files.

How the Script Works:
URL Formation:
A base URL is defined, which contains a placeholder ({:02d}) to insert state numbers.

Iterative Download:
The script loops from 1 to 56, representing the different states and territories.
For each iteration, it formats the URL with the current state number and fetches the respective Excel file.

State Name Extraction:
Once the file is fetched, it reads the Excel file to extract the state's name (to use as the file name).

File Saving:
The downloaded file is saved with the format <State Name>.xlsx.
If there's any issue extracting the state name, it defaults to default_<state number>.xlsx.

Error Handling:
If the file for a particular state number is not found or there's any other HTTP error, it prints an appropriate message and continues with the next state number.

Output:
Once the script completes its execution, you will find the downloaded Excel files named after the states in the directory where the script was run.

Note:
The script currently is set to download data for 56 states and territories. If the Census website updates its data or structure in the future, you might need to modify the script accordingly.
