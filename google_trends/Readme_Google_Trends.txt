Google Trends Data Extraction for Fashion Categories
This Python script allows you to extract trend data from Google Trends for various fashion categories, focusing on both top trending and rising trends across different seasons.

Dependencies:
pandas: Used for data handling and CSV file operations.
pytrends: Used to interface with Google Trends and pull data.
time: Used for delay to prevent rate limiting from Google.


How the Script Works:
Initialization:
Google Trends API is initialized.
Fashion categories and seasons with their date ranges are defined.

Data Extraction:
For each category and season, related topics and queries are fetched from Google Trends.
If an exception occurs, especially due to rate limiting (429 error), the script waits for a while and continues.

Data Aggregation:
Data for both topics and queries is aggregated season-wise.
The script categorizes data into 'top' and 'rising' trends.
All data is then saved into individual CSV files for each season.

Concatenation and Final CSV Generation:
Data from all seasons is concatenated.
Aggregated data is saved into separate CSV files.

Files Generated:
topic_<season_name>_top.csv: Contains top trending topics for each season.
topic_<season_name>_rising.csv: Contains rising trending topics for each season.
query_<season_name>_top.csv: Contains top trending queries for each season.
query_<season_name>_rising.csv: Contains rising trending queries for each season.
all_seasons_top_topics.csv: Contains top trending topics aggregated across all seasons.
all_seasons_rising_topics.csv: Contains rising trending topics aggregated across all seasons.
all_seasons_top_queries.csv: Contains top trending queries aggregated across all seasons.
all_seasons_rising_queries.csv: Contains rising trending queries aggregated across all seasons.

Notes:
Ensure you're not constantly fetching data in quick succession to avoid being rate-limited by Google.
Adjust the sleep durations as per your needs.
